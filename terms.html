                    <p class="p2"> Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track

                        online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for 
                        recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to 
                        DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be 
                        tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will 
                        inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="factor-sub-head">8. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h5>

                        We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an
